and on practicing effectively.

This article is for people that feel like they're in a rut, unable to improve at the skill they are training.

### Preamble
Getting good at a new thing takes a lot of time and practice. For the first few days/weeks/months, you will improve rapidly as you're eliminating the most common of beginner mistakes. 
This is why a lot people that are better at that skill than you are will tell you to "just do it more and more often".
In most cases, this is actually true.
What they don't specify however, is *how* to do it more, or more accurately:

How do you then improve at the post-beginner level and above?

### Defining a skill level
The first thing you have to realise is that skill is not constant.
If you just got started with a new skill, you're probably already better than the last time. 
Further along, you may notice that some days you're performing better than others.
You will not always be the same amount of "Good". 
That's all natural and completely fine.

<!-- Consider that skill is *not* formulated like the following:
```
Skill = Time * Effort
```

Instead, consider it like this:
```
Skill = ( Time * Effort ) ^ A whole bunch of external factors
``` -->

This is to say, you will have Good Days and you will have Bad Days.

|||
|-|-|
| Skill floor | The lowest level that you are able to consistently perform at. This is your average level of skill. |
| Skill ceiling | The level that you peak at. This is your personal limit. |

We place your skill on a line of beginner to leading expert. Between the two bars is your skill. 
The left bar is your skill floor and the right bar is your skill ceiling.

```
    ------|======|----------------------------
Beginner      Intermediate             Leading Expert
```

You should be able to reach your skill floor even if you are having a Bad Day. On Good Days, you can reach your skill ceiling.

### Mental barriers
Dedicating yourself to learning a new skill requires a strong growth mindset. A can-do attitude is invaluable.

> I can't do it *yet*, but with more practice and hard work, I will be able to do it.

#### Motivation and frustration
Motivation and frustration are two moods you will most often find yourself in during practice.
If you're having a Good Day, your motivation grows.
If you're having a Bad Day, your frustration grows. 

These two are each other's opposite and your goal is to find a balance between them in order to keep having fun.
Motivation is great, it keeps you practicing for longer and you're also more likely to have fun during practice.
Frustration is a downer, but don't let it discourage you.

> That doesn't mean "don't get emotional" though!

You should find a healthy way to channel your negative emotions (frustration) into positive emotions (motivation).

> Always remember: if you find yourself too frustrated and/or not having fun, calling it a day is fine.

#### Competition and comparing yourself to others
While competition is a great source of motivation, it can become a bigger source of frustration.
You may end up constantly comparing yourself to your peers and their improvement instead of that of your own.

You first, competition second.

### Effective practice
This is the important part of the article. 
Here are general guidelines for a consistent and effective practice schedule.

#### Push & Pull
Your practice should consist (pun intended) of two main phases: first Push, then Pull.

Remember those bars on the skill line from earlier?
|||
|-|-|
| Push | Increase skill ceiling by pushing your limit |
| Pull | Raise skill floor by focusing on technique, fixing mistakes and increasing your knowledge |

Experiment with the ratios in how much Push you do in relation to Pull. 
When you're a beginner, you should have a 1:1 ratio of pushing to pulling.

When you reach an intermediate level, vary in this ratio. 
Maybe you have a day where it feels like a Bad Day to Push, therefore you should Pull more.

> **Sidenote: The importance of warming up.**
> Warming up gets you into a state where your brain is already focused and your muscles are getting ready for the push.
> This makes focusing to increase your skill ceiling way easier than if you start pushing from a cold start.
> It also leaves you less prone to injury, which is very important for keeping your consistency.

#### Be consistent
Being consistent in your practice means that you have a set schedule for when and for how long you practice.
It becomes easier if you integrate that alotted time for practice into your daily routine.

For example: I have my practice session after dinner every other day and it lasts for 1.5 to 2 hours, maybe longer if I'm having a Good Day.

If your schedule has daily practice, it's important to know when you should take a rest day. 
A streak of Bad Days caused by Pushing too hard after Good Days can be very hard to deal with, both physically and mentally.
Allow yourself to recover, but make sure that they don't throw you off your routine.

#### Identify weak points
You will have points in your practice where you make a mistake or mess up.
Instead of moving on right away, try to analyze why you made that mistake or how you messed up. What caused it?
Recognizing this is essential to have a good Pull phase.

How exactly you can identify weak points varies from skill to skill, but asking someone more experienced than you is always a safe bet when getting started.
Even if what you're practicing is a solo endeavour, there is probably a community of people that are also practicing that same skill.
They can (and are willing to, if you ask nicely) give you pointers on where you have the most room for improvement.

Your next session you should then focus on those points.

### Conclusion
Improvement is not a straight line, it's like a staircase.
Not everybody walks the same staircase and you may improve faster than others, or the other way around.

However, it's important to recognize where you're personally falling short and working hard to fix that.
Comparing yourself to others won't help you do that, only you can work for you.

I hope my advice can help you use the time you are dedicating to the skill you choose to practice more effectively.

Being bad at practicing is also a skill issue.
